# responsive_navbar

This is nothing special only a basic responsive navbar which I use in my processwire projects so I thought this would be nice to have.
I use this for Processwire Projects and the content for the Navbar gets delievered by two modules called ProcessMenu and MarkupMenu developed by Kongondo.
